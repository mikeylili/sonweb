                <h3>What is Cookie Run?</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 12.3px; margin-top: 25px">Cookie Run is an endless running game and so the player runs automatically. There are two control buttons on the screen: Jump and Slide. Cookies can perform a Double Jump if the Jump button is tapped twice. The goal is to earn as many points as possible in the form of coins and jellies until the cookie fails to obstacles, enemies, or time. You can earn a "Bonus Time" to earn a lot more points by collecting the alphabet of those letters. The characters used are cookies, which can be upgraded and given power-ups to do better. The player can only play with the cookie for a certain amount of time before losing all their hearts. Once the cookie runs out of hearts, the player must wait for their hearts to regenerate,invite others to play the game, or pay for hearts.</p>
